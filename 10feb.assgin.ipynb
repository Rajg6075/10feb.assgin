    "In Python, the function used to open a file is open(). It is used to open a file on the disk and returns a file object that allows you to read from or write to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open() function takes two arguments: the file path (the name of the file to be opened) and the mode in which the file should be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Read Mode ('r'):\n",
    "This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading, and if the file does not exist, it raises a FileNotFoundError. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file, allowing you to read data from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write Mode ('w'):\n",
    "This mode opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, it will truncate the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, it will create a new file. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file, allowing you to write data to the file. Be cautious, as using this mode will overwrite the existing content of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append Mode ('a'):\n",
    "This mode opens the file for writing, but it appends data to the end of the file instead of truncating it. If the file does not exist, it will create a new file.
